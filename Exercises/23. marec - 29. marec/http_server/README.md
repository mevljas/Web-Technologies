# Assignment
- Write a simple HTTP server in Python
    - It should serve files inside some directory
    - It does not need to support parallel connections
- You have to implement
    - Accepting incoming connections (done)
    - Parsing of HTTP requests
    - Generation of HTTP responses
- The server should return either
    - The **contents of the resource** when the resource **exists**, or
    - A **404 message** when the **resource is not found**
- Testing your solution
    - Use Netcat to manually send HTTP requests
    - Use dedicated programs like curl
- https://curl.haxx.se/download.html
    - Use your web browser
