# 1st homework assignment
## Introduction
Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a **web application that runs entirely in the browser**. With the exception of jQuery, you are not allowed to use external libraries.

## Specifications
Your application can be of **any type**: a phonebook, an image gallery, or a simple game; it is entirely up to you. There are two additional requirements:

- Your application should not be a typical todo application or an application that does not substantially differ from a typical todo application;
- Your application shuold not be a simple modification of the application we worked on in the third lab session.
If you are unsure, ask in forums.

Make sure you will be able to complete the assignment in due time. You can find a couple of application suggestions below.

Your application has to meet the following requirements.

## 1 Data acquisition
Use appropriate HTML elements to allow the user to **input the data**. The input should be **appropriately validated** either by using JavaScript or HTML attributes.

## 2 Data manipulation
Your application should enable the user to perform various operation on the data:

- inserting,
- editing,
- deleting,
- sorting,
- querying (filtering, searching) etc.
You should implement at least **three such operations**.

As an example, the application that we were working with in the 3rd lab session (list of Web technologies participants), implements two such operations: insertion and deletion.

## 3 A non-trivial HTML5 feature
Your application should make use of at least **one non-trivial HTML5 feature**. Something along the lines of local storage, web workers, geolocation, drag&drop functionality etc.

## 4 Responsive design
You should design your application to be responsive.

In particular, your application should implement at least **two layouts**: one for mobile devices and the other for desktops. Make sure you implement the design using **mobile first** strategy.

Also, make sure that the user interface of your application is complex enough so that the two layouts make sense.

## 5 Non-functional requirements
Besides requirements 1-4, your application should also meet the following non-functional requirements.

### 5.1 Code organization
Put your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript **code into separate files**. Then use appropriate HTML elements to include them in the HTML document.

### 5.2 Valid HTML
All of your HTML should be valid and should pass the W3C validation test.

### 5.3 References (resources)
Create a dedicated page and list all references that you used in making this assignment.

Every code snippet which you did not write yourself, but you found it online and included in the assignment, should be listed as a reference. Additionally, every such reference should contain a sentence explaining how that code snippet helped you. You should also be able to explain and defend every snippet of the code that you submit.

The main application should **contain a link** to the references page.

## Appendix: Application examples
If you have a hard time figuring out what to build, consider the following three examples as starting points. Of course, your application may be something completely different -- these are only examples.

- An image gallery where the user can browse photos, change their display order, star them, annotate them with descriptions, search through descriptions etc. (Pictures are added to the gallery manually; by reading them from a file system, for instance.)
- An address book that allows the user to add, remove, update, delete and search contacts.
- A map-based road trip planner: use Google maps to display the map, annotate it with points of interest, add descriptions, comments etc. In such cases, you may use the external library to display and manipulate the map.
- Managing life expenses, showing incomes and expenses, drawing graphs; the graphs are drawn manually, witout using external libraries.
- An application that tracks and monitors your car's fuel consumption.
