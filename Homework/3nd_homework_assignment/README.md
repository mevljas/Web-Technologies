# 3rd homework assignment: Instructions
## Instructions
For the third homework assignment, each student has to create a web application. The domain of the application can be arbitrary, as long it is not an on-line store or something that does not differ much from an on-line store.

The application has to be implemented in PHP and MySQL, however, where appropriate, you should also use additional technologies that were presented during the course, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX and others. Moreover, you are welcome to use 3rd party libraries and frameworks such as Bootstrap, Symphony, Zend and similar.

While the scope of the application can be arbitrary, be careful not to underestimate the workload. Make sure that you are able to complete the assignment within give time. The bare minimum requirements are the following:

- User registration and log-in: Your application should support both anonymous and logged-in users, that is, some actions are available to all users, while others are available only to those that have logged-in. Additionally, make sure that users are also able to register.
- Input validation: Your application should validate all client inputs. When inputs are invalid, the application should notify the client with a suitable notification.
- DBMS: Use MySQL (or MariaDB) and design a database that has at least three tables. The tables should be related (i.e. connected) and the database should be normalized to the third normal form.
- Nice user interface: Use suitable technologies (CSS, JS, jQuery, AJAX) and design a user-friendly interface.
- Proper HTTP requests: All HTTP requests within your application should follow the recommendation of the HTTP standard.
