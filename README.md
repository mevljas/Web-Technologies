## Objectives and competences
The primary objective of this course is to introduce
students a Web as a distributed system and the use of
online technologies on the client and server-side. The
acquired knowledge will enable students to develop
their own webpages, websites and web applications.
The theoretical and practical work helps them to
develop skills for understanding and solving creative
professional challenges in computer and information
science and for independent work in solving technical
problems and to apply the acquired practical skills and
knowledge of software technologies for successful
professional work.
## Intended learning outcomes
Knowledge and understanding:
Knowledge of web (Internet) presented as a distributed
system that operates on the principle of client-server
model.
Understanding the development and programming of
web applications, services at the level of engineering
work.
Application:
Use of web technologies in the area of web engineering,
both at the client side as server side.
Reflection:
Insight and understanding of the theory of web
technology and its application in practical work, both in
the laboratory and in real applications.
Transferable skills:
Design and development of web solutions in various
engineering, as well as other areas.
